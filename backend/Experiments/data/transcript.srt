 Have you ever heard of a tri? No, not the verb try. I'm talking about the data structure called a tri,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 spelled T-R-I-E. Imagine you're organizing a massive library but instead of books you're

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 dealing with words. A tri is like a tree of arrays that allows you to store and retrieve

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 these words at lightning-fast speeds. Picture each letter of the alphabet having its own shelf.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 To store a word, you simply place it on the shelf corresponding to its first letter.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Then each subsequent letter gets its own subshelf branching off from the previous one.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 The magic happens when you're looking for a specific word. No matter how many words are

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 in the library, you can find any word in the same amount of time just by following the path

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 created by its letters. So the next time you're typing on your phone and the keyboard seems to

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 magically predict the word you want, remember the humble tree? The unsung hero of lightning-fast

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 word retrieval.
