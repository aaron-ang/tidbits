    "script": "<speak>\nHave you ever wondered how your contacts app finds your friends' numbers so quickly? \ud83e\udd14 It's thanks to a clever data structure called a <emphasis>hash table</emphasis>.\n\nImagine you're at a library, and you need to find a specific book. \ud83d\udcda You could search through every single shelf, but that would take forever! Instead, libraries use the <emphasis>Dewey Decimal System</emphasis>, which is like a hash table for books.\n\nIn a hash table, your friends' names are organized into different \"buckets\" based on the first letter of their name. \ud83c\udf6f So when you search for your friend \"Emma\", the app only needs to look in the \"E\" bucket, making the search <emphasis>lightning-fast</emphasis>! \u26a1\n\nThe catch? If you have too many friends with the same first letter, the buckets can overflow, slowing things down. \ud83d\ude05 But most of the time, hash tables are a <emphasis>game-changer</emphasis> for speedy searches! \ud83c\udf89\n\nSo the next time you find a contact in a flash, you can thank the power of hash tables! \ud83d\ude04\n<break time=\"1s\"/>\n</speak>",
